# Covid19
This is the Covid 19 informative webpage.
In this webpage anyone can get the information how to protect from covid19 , preventive measures along with a bot which answer the questions regarding the covid-19 virus.
I have used HTML, CSS, AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNTS , STATIC WEBAPP SERVICE for this project.
Storage accounts is used to store the code in the cloud container and static webapp is used to host the webpage.
